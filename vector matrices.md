1. Equation : 
   mathematical equation that shows two things are equal.
   . x + 2 = 5

2. Linear equation : Straight, no change . 
   (Constant rate of change)
   The graph is a straight line for this.
   . ax + b = 0

3. Exponential equation : 
   Continous changes. (mathematical equation has a variable in the exponent and grows).
   . y = a^x

4. Multiple Linear equation : 
   set of linear equations more than one variable.(that mean we will have 2 or more equations)
    . In linear equation we just have to find one variable x.
    . but here we should find based on the problem like x, y,z this is     called multiple linear equation. 

5. Optimization : 
    Finding the best solution under the given conditions. 
    .if we have so many 1000 records and 1 million features,  
    .we just optimise that means we minimise the features to get the records.

MATRICES:-
 Matrix : 
   Set of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
   . matrix dimensions are rows and columns.
   . Matrix is an rectangular array.
   . row is horizontal. column is vertical.

TYPES OF MATRICES:-
1. Rectangular Matrix :
   With m rows and n columns( that means different rows and different columns).
   m*n matrix.

2. Square Matrix :
   with same number of rows and columns.
   n*n matrix.

3. Diagonal Matrix :
   having values on the diagonal side and 0 on the rest.

4. Row matrix :
   having only one row.

5. column matrix :
   having only one column. 

6. Scalar matrices :
   having equal diagonal values and 0 on the rest.

7. Identity matrix :
   having 1 as the diagonal values and 0 on the rest.
   . symbol is I.

8. zero matrix : 
   null matrix having zeros.

9. Equal matrices :
   if each element is same from the corresponding matrix.

10. Negative matrix : 
    if having + sign, we change it to - and if having - sign we change it to +.

11. transpose matrix :
    Swapping rows and columns. 

12.
