1. Equation : mathematical equation that shows two things are equal.
   Example: x + 2 = 5

2. Linear equation : Straight, no change . (Constant rate of change)
The graph is a straight line for this.

3. Exponential equation : Continous changes. (mathematical equation has a variable in the exponent and grows).

4. Multiple Linear equation : set of linear equations more than one variable.(that mean we will have 2 or more equations)
    In linear equation we just have to find one variable x but here we should find based on the problem like x, y,z this is called multiple linear equation. 

5. Optimization :
